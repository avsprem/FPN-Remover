# FPN-Remover

Composite-type Optical Fiberscope (COF) is a endoscope technology.
COF consists of two functional types of fibres, laser and image. 
The laser fibre is aligned at the centre of the COF while the imaging fibres are tightly packed and surrounded by the laser fibre. 
Due to the alignment of the image fibres in the COF, the video frames contain a Fixed Pattern Noise (FPN), also called Bee Hive noise. 
This simple project to remove FPN.
